# Swift for Python Programmers

## 1. Variables and Constants

Unlike python, there are Variables and Constants in Swift

Constants, once defined using the `let` keyword cannot have their values changed

```swift
let count = 2;
```

You define Variables using `var` much like JavaScript

```swift
var step = 1;
```

### 1.1 Multiple declarations

```swift
var x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
```

> Whitespaces before and after the `=` are important!
